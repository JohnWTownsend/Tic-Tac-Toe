# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe. 

*Made with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS*

  This project is something I took up midway through my Web Applications
  course at DSU. I later updated it after having more experience with js and jquery. This is the project that started my weird js project phase. :)
